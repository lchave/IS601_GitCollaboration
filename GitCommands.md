# Git Commands
##1. Commit
A commit is a snapshot of a project history. It is used to save changes to a local Git repository. Commits acts as a project directory and should be used after each step is complete or a change is made. This is the only way the repository can reflect the changes made to a project.

For example: after adding a new branch to a project in WebStorm, in order for the changes to be reflected in the local repository, the next step would be to use the commit command.
